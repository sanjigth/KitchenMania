# Use Cases

## Use Case Diagram - Advertisement System

Use case diagram that showcases the idea behind the **Advertisement System** that we would like to incorporate into our project. 

The Advertisement System is designed with the intent to give a few ads once in awhile in order for us to keep the web application free and eventually make a smartphone version for both iOS and Android, of course free of charge as well.
This also gives the user the ability to purchase a advertisement remover (basically like paying a fee to own the game) in order to take out the ad's when playing and having more ideal experience. 

## Use Case Diagram - Future Content System

Use case diagram that showcases the idea behind the **Future Content System** that we would like to incorporate into our project. 

The concept behind this is that we would like to implement a feature where the user will be able to purchase DLC (downloadable content) which would provide different themes (limited editions as well!) and integration to smartphones eventually. 

## Use Case Diagram - Hi-Score Tracking System 

Use case diagram that showcases the idea behind the **Hi-Score Tracking System** that we would like to incorporate into our project. 

This system is designed to eventually allow the players to store their hi-scores from each respective level and showcase it to others by storing it on the account as a viewable "trophy" or sharing it on social with friends.
This is tied to the login system so that the user has somewhere to tie the hi-scores to.

## Use Case Diagram - Login System 

Use case diagram that showcases the idea behind the **Login System** that we incorporated within our project. 

The main componenet of the system that controls how the previous Use cases will interact. The necessity of this Use case is key to web application since the user must be able to tie in their information regarding hi-scores and the account features for future content as well as the advertisement system. The user will be able to store those details into the database as it will be tied down to their email address (essentially their username) so that they will be able to access it whenever they successfully login into the web application.
