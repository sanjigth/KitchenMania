# Requirements

## JamBoard Screenshots

These screenshots are from the Jamboard discussions that were held between the user and developers to figure out what possible requirements are necessary and what we can consider for future use if possible based on the constraints of the requirement.

## List of Requirements

Requirement list that includes the ID, Kind, Risk and Description of each Requirement that we wanted to implement within our web application.

Due to constraints and time, not all requirements were able to be implemented into our web application. 

Most of the focus was based towards the requirements with a **High** risk. 

## Requirement Diagram 

Requirement Diagram with the test cases included, including for future implementation of some of the requirements and features we did not add at the current time. 

## Use Case Scenario 

Our Use Case Scenario which was used to create the Noun Phrases table that shows the importance between **Objects**, **Attributes**, **Actors**, and **irrelevance**.

This was created from a lab activity and is very useful for us to distinguish the importance between many components in our current web application. 

## User Stories - Requirements 

These User Stories are the results from the Jamboard screenshots from above, properly creating the notation to specify what was requested and what is considered the acceptance critieria in order to use the requested requirements.

This includes what the possible scenario would be for the acceptance criteria to have a rough idea on what the concept of the requirement would be.
