## Project Details

### Product Vision

On Feb 1, 2021 at Cooking Mania Co., we conducted a meeting to determine what our stakeholders would want out of a game from us. We discussed a pre-existing game that we developed and where they would like to see it go. Within the meeting we were able to come up with a vast number of ideas that will allow us to create a highly addictive web browser and possibly in the future mobile game. 
The overall vision of our game is to create a fun puzzle game where families and friends can compete against each other to be the top of the leaderboard.

### Objectives

Kitchen Mania currently has three playable levels, you must advance through each level to play the next. 

As you increase to the next level, the amount of points required must be cleared WITHIN the given moveset. (This information will be shown as you play the game)

If you fail to clear the level within the given moveset, you may attempt it again - likewise, if you wish to play the same level again after SUCCESSFULLY completing it -
you will be given the option to MOVE FORWARD to the next level or RETRY the same level.

### Game Rules

1) In order to gain points within the game, you must match the "food" items within the board in either a **ROW** or **COLUMN** of 3 or 4.
2) As you clear the "food" items, more of the food items will drop in from the top of the board so you are able to continue matching these items.
3) The movement of the food items are limited to dragging upwards, downwards, right or left ONLY.
