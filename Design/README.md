## Conceptual Model - Class Diagram

Conceptual Model Class diagram which includes the classes listed within the diagram and their responsbilities to the web application. 

## Kitchen Mania - Class Model

A Class Model of the Kitchen Mania software, includes attributes and operations important and key to each class that is necessary to run the program properly and as intended. 

## Sequence Diagram - Class Level

A Sequence Diagram done at the class level, starting from the user input to the potential features of login system to the ability to save hi-scores from each level as they increase (currently from 1 - 3)

## Sequence Diagram - System Level

Sequence Diagram done at the system level, this explores a bit more and shows the idea of how the hi-score functionality would work based on clearing each level, as well as having the ability to show the user their score (viewable after each level and on their profile).

## State Diagram - Principle Class

State Diagram designed on the principle class of the software. It shows the process of how the login system works; using a verification system to make sure the credentials are valid, and if they are not the user should be able to create credentials in order to access the web application. Once they are able to login, they can proceed to play the game and follow through with the rest of the features tied to the hi-score system and saving those scores to be accessible and shareable.
